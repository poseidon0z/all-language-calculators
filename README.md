# All Language Calculators
A calculator in every programming language we learn!

## Why this?
We feel that a simple program, like a calculator is a great example to show people how a language's syntax looks, and also to show how well we have progressed in a language.

## What next?
We will add more calculators, in more languages or having more features, as we show of newer skills!
